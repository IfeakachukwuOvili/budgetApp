Budget Tracker – Component Structure and Explanation
What’s a Wrapper Component?
In React, a wrapper component is a structural component that surrounds other components to provide a shared layout or behavior. It’s useful when you want to apply consistent styling, navigation, or functionality across different parts of your application without duplicating code.

In this project, the Main.jsx component serves as the wrapper. It provides a common layout structure that includes navigation and a decorative image, while also handling the rendering of child routes using the Outlet component from React Router.

How the Main component works:

Retrieves shared data (such as userName) using the useLoaderData() hook.

Defines a layout structure with a container div.

Renders the Nav component and passes the userName as a prop.

Uses the Outlet component as a placeholder for matched child routes.

Displays a consistent visual element (wave image) across pages.

By using this wrapper, the layout and navigation remain consistent, providing a cohesive experience across the app.
