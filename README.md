# 💸 BudgetApp JS

[![Built with React](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built%20With-React-blue?style=flat&logo=react)](https://reactjs.org/)

A budgeting app built with React Router and a generous serving of sarcasm. Originally a tutorial clone, now featuring... one custom login page. Yep. We’re wild like that.

## 📺 Tutorial Reference

**YouTube**: [Build a Budgeting App with React Router](https://youtu.be/VpzeeBeVWeg?si=HKVleyWkJk63Pymj)

Let’s be real: this project was built almost line-for-line from a YouTube tutorial—yes, down to the last semicolon. I had *big* plans to personalize it, sprinkle in some originality, maybe even pretend I was innovating.

But halfway through?

> **Brain:** “What if you just... built your *own* app instead?”  
> **Me:** “Say less.”

**Spoiler:** I *did* understand what was going on. So this one? Still mostly untouched—except the login page, which got a mini glow-up just to prove I was paying attention.

## ⚠ Heads-Up

This tutorial does **not** hold your hand. No gentle intros. No slow explanations. You’re thrown into the deep end with the expectation that you already know:

- HTML  
- JavaScript  
- React  
- React Router

So buckle up.

## 💾 Data Storage

This version uses **local storage** (`localhost`) to save your data.  
In my next budgeting project, [**DinoTracker**](#), I attempted to use a **MongoDB** database like a grown-up. Stay tuned.

## 🧠 Why I Did This

I built this app as prep for a **24-hour hackathon**, thinking:

> “Let’s learn how to budget... while also budgeting my time.”

Plot twist: learning under pressure requires **focus**. Who knew?

## 🙌 Credit Where Credit’s Due

Massive thanks to the tutorial creator for making a great starting point.  
You can watch the original walkthrough here:

I did tweak the login page, mostly to reassure myself I wasn’t just robotically copy-pasting. Feel free to watch the video for the full, unaltered experience.

## 🚧 Coming Eventually (Maybe)

- A full redesign?  
- Real database integration?  
- Me pretending like this wasn’t from a tutorial?

Stay tuned. Or don’t. I’m not your boss.
Oh, by the way, here is a sneakpeak for those who don't want to clone the code to see the vision :)
